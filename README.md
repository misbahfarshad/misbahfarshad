Hi, Iâ€™m Misbah Arshad! I have a Master of Public Policy from the University of Chicago and a B.A. International Relations from the University of Michigan. 
My background is in international development and museum advancement. 

I came to the University of Chicago to develop my quantitative analysis skills;
I spent my first year at Harris to hone my data skills and most of my second year at Booth to improve my management and strategy skills. 
Check out my LinkedIn for my professional portfolio and take a look around my Githbub (starting with the "Big Data" repo) for my data projects!
